Missed morning roll call

Lori, I was walking home,

I don't mean to pry, your honor,
but is everything okay at home?

From the top of my head,
I can remember the case of a woman

A woman with long, flowing hair

You're leaving out the most
important factor, your honor. 不考虑,遗漏

in the wake of
that team giving us what our hearts have yearned for all our lives

we have fallen victim to a delirium

Self-imposed death sentence

The irony is palpable

I was under the impression I hired

I'm embarrassed

these people do suffer from

What could possibly have impelled                                                
you to delude these people?
