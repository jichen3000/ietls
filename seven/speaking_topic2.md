Describe a place that you would like to visit:

Well, then, I would like to talk about a city called Kyoto which I will travel to in the next month with one of my friends.
We've planed to go OOsaka by airplane firstly, then take the high speed train to Kyoto where we will spent 5, 6 days to visit.

Regarding to why I like this city, there are tow reasons.
Firstly, since I was a child, I was a big fan about the Japanese culture.
Because, I played a lot of Japanese vedio games which was enjoy high popularity in that time.
And 5,6 years ago I even learned Japanese a lot which I suppose it is quite easier to Chinese, since there are so many
Chinese characters in that language.
 So I had a dream to travel there in the future.

This is one point, as well as this, Kyoto which is the most famous city in Japan which is deeply steeped in Japanese history and tradition.
That means this city have lots of historical buildings, such as shrines and temples.
Which is a good channel for foreigners to broaden their understanding about the Japanese culture. 
These buildings can provide us fanscinating insight into Japanese history and culture.
because they are quite representative in Japan. 
And also the local people preserve many traditions, such as wearing the kimono which is ..., to visit the  temple. 

2.
Describe a person who taught you a useful skill.

Well, then I would like to talk about a person called Xubin who was my previouse colleague, and also has been one my friends. He taught me a lot about how to manager a team. But he didn't just tell me what I should do, in most case, when I had a issue in management, I would like to discuss it with him, and he always give me some useful ideas which have proven very effective in my practice.

As for why this skill are very conducive to me, I suppose there are two main reasons. 
one is that it helped me a lot in my last project. One year ago, I leaded a backup team, that means we were team B, if team A was ok, we would just need to handle some very easy tasks, such as support work. But finally we substituted for the Team A, owing to my management was very well. And therefore my team had became an efficient and effective one which can resolve the issues the other can't handle.
This is one, as well as this is I believe in the future, management skill will be more important in my career, since this skill has been become an very basic one for many decent jobs. What I want to say is many jobs which I want get in the future will be more involved in the management.

3.
Describe a book you have read that was recommended by someone.
explain what you learned from it.


Well, then I would like to talk about a book which I have read. The book called Does god play dice which was recommended by one of my friend. Actually he is a big fan of reading, and always like to recommend books which he believe are quite good to me.
So last month, I just read that book which introduced a lot about latest development in Physics, especially the quantum theory.

Regarding to what I've learned from it. I would say first of all, it broadened my horizon and enriched my knowledged about the quantum theory. I knew who discoveried it, and why the most of scientists were against it originally, even including the Albert Einstein. This theory was just too difficult to understand, people would felt so confused when they firstly heard it.
This is one point, as well as this, I also found this book was so interesting, even it was a book related latest physics.You know, usually these books are just monotonous and boring, or just full of the special terms which general public cannot easily understand. But this one was quite uniqual. The main reason being that is it is full of the stories about how the scientists argue about their own theory, and how they prove it by experiments.
