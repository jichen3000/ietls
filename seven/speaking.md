# 总体的逻辑
根据不同的
part -> content(description->explaination) -> topics
story -> topics -> part -> content -> sentences -> words
要有自己的故事，也就是说，说地要尽量和自己相关，这样既有特点，内容又不容易空洞。
注意举例，和自己相关的。
五句中只要有一句有特色的就可以了。
总起，分论点，举例，或解释，或对比
语音清晰，要有停顿


# 以下为雅思口语7分的标准
## Fluency and coherence

- speaks at length **without noticeable effort** or loss of coherence
- may demonstrate language-related **hesitation** at times, or some **repetition** and/or **self-correction**
- uses a range of connectives and discourse markers with some **flexibility**

用最简单的中文理解就是：顺其自然，感觉在聊天。也就是说，核心词是：自然(Just let nature thake its course)！其实，想想平时聊天说话的时候，我们也会偶尔犹豫一下，也会偶尔重复使用某个词儿，也会偶尔自我更新一下发音，但这都是基于一种顺其自然 的、甚至是一种本能的自我调整。所以，基于这种判断，在进考场之前，请你们不断给自己一个心理暗示：“我又不是上法庭答辩，又不是开记者招待会，我来不就是跟你这个破老外聊聊天嘛！任何一个正常的人都会说错话，都会用错字眼，都会重复使用某些词，但这完全不代表我们的口头表达能力有问题。”

## Lexical resource

- uses vocabulary resource **flexibly to discuss** a variety of topics
- uses some **less common and idiomatic vocabular** and shows some awareness of style and collocation, with some inappropriate choices
- uses **paraphrase** effectively

用最简单的中文理解就是：用词到位，解释清楚。在这里，我想说的一点是：请你不要把口语当成写作，请你不要写作用的大词搬到口语中来，这是很要命的。说话是否有魅力不在于你是否使用了什么“之乎者也”的大词，而在于你是否清晰地呈献出你想表达的思维逻辑。不光是英文，中文也是如此，请你想想为什么郎咸平教授的演讲那么有魅力那么受观众的青睐，他从来不说什么高深的、“xx主义”之类的理论，却又能用很简单的语言去很好地表达了那些理论所蕴含的内在逻辑，就连七八十岁的老太太都听得懂他说的是什么。这话扯远了，我想说的是，请你不要首先着急背什么词汇，用什么句型。这不是写作，这是口语！关键是“先有观点，再有词汇”，然后顺着“复杂中文--->简单中文--->简单英文--->复杂英文”的思路来组织语言。单词固然重要，但它绝对不能妨碍我们的思考和表达，更加不能为了用某个词而让我们的观点妥协了。在下文我会一个一个topic的分析，究竟我们需要什么样的词汇，怎么铺排这些词汇

## Grammatical range and accuracy
- uses a range of **complex structures** with some flexibility
- frequently produces error-free sentences, though **some grammatical mistakes** persist

用最简单的中文理解就是：句式结构多样性和允许语法错误。请注意，这里的句式结构多样性没有写作的那样复杂。本人觉得在句子结构多样性方面，你可以着重从并列句，转折句，定语从句，状语从句（地点状语从句，时间状语从句），宾语从句，虚拟语气（特别是“if I was/were···,I would···”和“without···, I would”）,表语从句(例如：the reason behind this situation is that···.),被动语态等方面努力。请你尽量少用、甚至不要用强调句，主语从句，同位语从句等句型，因为这些句式太容易导致自己思维错乱和表达不清。其实说实在地，在悉尼大学上了三年的课，也没见多少教授喜欢运用复杂句型来讲课。简单句（主语+谓语+宾语）永远都应该是口语的主角。

至于常见的语法无非就是如下三种：没有区分名词单复数，没有注意动词单复数和时态，错用he和she。只要克服这三个最基本也是最最最主要的语法错误，老外就会默认你没有语法错误了。

## Pronunciation
- shows all positive features of Band 6 and some, but not all, of the positive features of Band 8

### Band 8
- uses a wide range of **pronunication features**
- sustains flexible use of features, with **only occasional lapses**
- is easy to understand throughout; L1 accent has minimal effect on intelligibility

### Band 6
- uses a range of pronunciation features with **mixed control** 
- shows some effective use of features but this is not sustained 
- can generally be understood throughout, though mispronunciation of individual words or sounds reduces clarity at times

说到发音，这就是我的绝对弱项。你说发音很重要吧，它确实很重要，能有一口纯真的英音或者美音能给考官特别好的印象。但是，发音，说实话，也不是那么样的重要。本人到目前为止还不能准确地区分dʒ，ʒ，ŋ, j, th, v, w等几个辅音的发音，但这并不妨碍本人获得7分甚至更高。我的朋友Peter发音也不算太好，但是他照样拿9分。其实我觉得剑桥雅思在这面还是挺体贴世界各地的考生的，它比较理解各地的考生由于方言的影响而无法达到native speaker的水平。 发音不好并不代表意思表达差，有方言口音并不妨碍交流对话的进行。当然，我并是说发音真的不需要注意。但是我想说的是，与其花大力气去做一些低产出的事情，还不如集中力量考虑口语的答题模式

# 雅思口语的三个部分要求
## PART 1
这个阶段主要是一个让考生热身(**warm-up**)，让考官初步了解考生(gain first impression from candidates)的过程。这个部分的核心词是：**description**。 考官想测试你一下对客观事物的英文描述能力，也就是说(that is to say)，考官问的绝大数问题都是你的所见所闻，你要做的就是一五一十地罗列和陈述。简单来说，这部分的重点就是“**说说家常，聊聊生活**”。


## PART 2
这个阶段开始处于一个过渡阶段，核心词是：**description+explanation**。卡片的设计都是从what, who, where, when过渡到how & why。 很多烤鸭包括很多中国老师都认为，在这个section里面最为重要的就是回答卡片的最后一个问题，也就是explain。按照他们的逻辑，假如只顾着回答前面的what, who, when, where的问题而没来及说how & why，分数必定被拉低。事实是这样吗？实践是检验真理的唯一标准(practice is the sole criterion for testing truth)。我最近考的三次(2011年2月12日，2月26日，3月5日)在回答Part 2卡片题的时候都没来得及或者没答完最后那个问题就被考官打住了；但这不妨碍我拿到7分以上。所以我总结得出，重点不是你是否机械般地把题目回答完，而是你是否把所有的问题整合一个属于你的故事，整理出一个很清晰的脉络。简单来说，这部分的重点是“**说说故事，聊聊感想**”。

## PART 3
这个阶段已经过渡到需要你的**explanation**了。这个部分毫无疑问是抢分的**黄金机会**，也是露家底的时候。如果说，part 2 topics还能事先准备的话，那么这部分的问题大部分都是即兴的，互动的，弹性的。要把这部分的题目提前准备，几乎不可能，或者说是，大海捞针(just like looking for a needle in a haystack)，事倍功半(get half the results with twice the effort)。这里的重点是解释说明。通常解释说明分为：**举例子说明**(use an example to illustrate)，**分析前因后果**(interpret the cause and effect)和**纵向横向比较**(compare in vertical and/or hozontial direction)。点不需要多，但一定要深入，合理，有逻辑。所以我认为这部分的重点是“**说说道理，聊聊影响**”。

**从stories到topics**

# my prepared topics:
an interesting conversation with someone you didn't know.

Well, then, I would like to talk about a talk which happend about a year ago, when I was travelling in India.

The man whom I talked with was an Korean. And we came across each other in an india train which speed was quite low. That meant that journey costed us about 12 hours. Therefore, we chatted a lot such as our travling experiences and other things.
