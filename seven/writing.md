# 整体逻辑
题型--->结构--->观点--->句型--->词汇

## 题型
何谓题型？其实雅思写作task2题型一般有三大类：report，argumentation 和 “report + argumentation” 的结合体。

## 结构
对于不同的题型，使用不同的结构，但基本就是四段或五段。

### report

- cause
- influence
- solution
也就是说，要么就是问你这个现象产生的原因，要么就是这个现象产生了什么样的影响（积极或消极的），要么就是叫你提出解决方案。通常report类的文体，不会同时出现以上三个要素，只会有一到两个的配搭，即：cause＋influence，cause+solution，influence+solution，或只问influence (如下面我写的一篇7分文章，问effects on individuals and societies)。所以呢，在这种题型底下，它的结构就非常的单一：开头段+ 原因分析段（一般分析3个原因）+ 影响分析段（一个列举3个影响）+ 解决办法段（这些解决办法一定要对应于之前分析的原因或者影响）+ 结尾段。这个结构是应该视情况而定(as the case may be)

所以基本就写中间**两段**，每段一句开头提出**总论点**，**三个支持观点**。一定要有支持观点，但不要求深刻

### argumentation
- discuss both views and give your own opinion
- to what extent do you agree or disagree
- do you think the advantage outweigh the disadvantage
discuss both views and give your own opinion， 三段，或两段
开头段（回应题目+表达自己的观点）
结尾段（表明自己的观点）
至于agree/disagree or advantage/disvantage 题型，根据考官的推介，最理想的结构是：开头段+让步段+ 支持段（论点1）+ 支持段（论点2）+ 结尾段（表明你自己的观点）。万一想不出让步段，或者时间太紧了来不及让步，可以吗？考官说了，允许便秘，憋不出来也是可以的！！！！也就是说，在这种情况下，可以使用一面倒，而且不影响你拿7分（假如你的目标分数是8分，就当我瞎说吧）。

注意，对于观点也要有自己的故事，就是加入和自己相关的案例。

# questions:
these sentences could be safely used in my article.

# 7分标准
## task response
- addresses **all** parts of the task
- presents **a clear position** throughout the reponse
- **presents**, **extend** and **supports** main ideas, but there may be a tendency to over-generalise and/or supporting ideas may lack focus

用中文最简单的理解是：**首尾都要回答问题**，允许**泛泛而谈**。这就是说，我们没必要花太多的精力去考虑观点是否绝对严谨是否意义深刻，关键是要告诉考官你的思考逻辑。这就是剑桥雅思的魅力，它要考你的不是你的思维能力，而是你的语言表达能力。哪怕在ridiculous的观点，只要你能用最恰当的语言去表达，你也可以同样得7分（当然，如果你的目标是8分，你就当我痴人说话吧）。还有就是说，很多题目本身包含很广泛的概念，很多大学教授用十几万字都解释不清的关系，怎么就能让我们这些门外汉用三言两语就解释好呢。说了这么多，我想说的是，如果你从一开始就习惯背诵满分作文，习惯复制别人的观点，这样的复习方法会很吃力（我不敢说是错的，那是确实低效，甚至有赌博成分），事倍功半。毕竟我们都是正常人，我们都有自己的思考能力和理解能力，我们说的每一个观点都是make sense，不make sense的是我们没把那个观点说清楚。

## coherence and cohesion
- **logically organises** information and ideas, there is clear progression throughout
- lises a range of **cohesive devices** appropriately although there may be some under-or over use
- presents a clear topic within each paragragh

用中文最简单的意思是：分段分点，每点之前必须有连接词。这一点非常非常容易达到（我总结了大量这样的词汇，明天或者后天上传上来）。然后那个考官最为推介的范式（以argumentation的题目为例，因为report类的文章更死板了）：开头段+主体段（让步一段，支持（反对）两段）+结尾段。其实说白了，就是我们最熟悉不过的模版。 也就是说，模版是非常有用的，之所以变成没用（serve no helpful purpose）是因为用模范的那个人没有用（想起粤语里面的一句歇后语，叫“太监撒尿”）。至于怎么用模版才能变得不落于俗套，下文回答问题7的时候会有详细分析。

## lexcial resource
- uses a sufficient range of vocabulary to allow some flexibility and precision
- uses less common lexical items with some awareness of style and collocation
- may produce occasional erros in word choice, spelling and/or word formation

用中文最简单的意思是：足够就好，不需要多；一两个大词就够，不需要滥。一说到单词，相信我们并不陌生，甚至认为学英语就是背单词，写作就是单词的选美与堆砌。尽管我们都知道这是不对的，但是依旧默默地坚持着，比如说背诵一大堆同义词代换，一大堆除了莎士比亚见过之外其他人都没见过的大词。这样的复习会很累而且会逐渐把雅思写作从逻辑表述变成词汇大杂烩。至于何谓是足够的单词，何谓是less common lexical items，这就是问题6的范畴了。经过我写了大概30篇雅思作文，我觉得我们需要的词汇其实真的不多（我的词汇表一定会upload上来，估计在明天或者后天）。我想说的是，记单词最好的方法是，把单词放到句型或者例句上面来，然后句型或者例句一定要与雅思写作topic 相关。如果不相关，证明那个词就算记住了，也不会用。

## Grammatical range and accuracy
- uses a variety of **complex structures**
- produces frequent error-free sentences
- has good control of grammar and punctuation but may make **a few mistake**

用中文最简单的意思是：句子结构多样性和允许语法错误的存在。对于句子结构多样性，这一点，我觉得我们中国学生肯定没问题的，什么定语从句，什么名词性从句，什么状语从句，倒装句，虚拟语态，被动语态等，我们只会过犹不及。从我的个人经验来看，我有时候会把定语从句和同位语从句搞乱（并不是我们不知道有什么不同，而是一紧张就很容易忽视了）。说到语法错误，我可以说，我们中国学生最最最常犯的语法错误都是非常低级（请参考part.4内容）。
