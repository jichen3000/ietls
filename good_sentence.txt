As the quest for oil intensifies, supermajors will probably take on more risks, both political (tie-ups with dodgy regimes) and geological (investing billions to extract hydrocarbons the Earth is reluctant to give up). They are already doing a fair bit of both. Even Exxon, renowned for its capital discipline, has struck riskier-than-usual deals in the Arctic and the Black Sea with Russia’s state oil firm, Rosneft.
Life is getting harder for the supermajors.
Their edge over their rivals—the ability to extract oil from difficult places—is terrifically useful while prices are high.
