You should spend about 20 minutes on this task.

You cannot go to a company where you got an offer. Write a letter to the HR supervisor to
1. Explain the reason why you decline the offer
2. Express you gratitude
3. Explain you like your current job very much.

You should write at least 150 words.

You do NOT need to write your own address. Begin your letter as follows:

Dear Sir,

model answer:

Dear Sir,

I was a potential employee to whom you made a job offer. I would like to extend my thanks for such an offer, especially at such a company as yours. It is, however, with deepest regret that I must decline your generous invitation and apologize for any inconvenience I may have caused.

I appreciate immensely the interview organized by your company and the extensive effort made by all the staff involved. Their attitude was impressive and highly commendable. As such I must pass my sincerest apologies for any difficulties related to the extra work that must have been involved, and the time wasted on your behalf. Although the offer was substantial, it wasn't enough to encourage me to sever the bonds with my current employer. During my time at my present company my superiors supported me and fostered my career. In short, they made me the employee I am today.

I would like to keep the lines of communication open between our two parties, and look forward to further correspondence.

Yours sincerely
