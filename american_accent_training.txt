Reduced Sounds
  Reduced sounds are 'valleys'
  Your peaks are going to be quite strong, but your valleys, blurry.
  Articles(a, the) are usually very reduced sounds. Before a consonant, the and a are both schwa sounds. Before a vowel, however, you'll notice a change the schwa of the turns into a long [e] plus a connecting 'y'.
