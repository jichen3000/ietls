Pronunciation:
  Weak and strong forms
    If you use weak forms correctly, you will be more fluent and you will sound more like a native speaker. Knowing about weak forms will also help you understand the examiner more easily; it is easy to miss weak forms because they are unstressed.
    Strong and weak forms chart P13.
    Other function words also have weak forms:
      positive auxiliary verbs( can must do shall was are)
      pronouns ( her you them your)
      conjunctions( and but because('cos) than)
      article(a an the) bloke
  Word stress:
    Word stess is crucial in English. If you stress the wrong syllable, the listener may have trouble understanding you. Always mark the stressed syllable when you note down a new word.
    Rule A: Tow-syllable nouns and adjectives are most often stressed on the first syllable.
    Rule B: There are words that can be either a noun or a verb. If they are spelt the same and have two syllables, the noun ( and adjective) is usually stressed on the first syllable, whereas the verb on the second syllable.
    Rule C: Words that end in -sion and -tion have the stress on the penultimate(倒数第二next to last)syllable.
    
Grammar: Speculating
  The questions above ask about an unreal situation. To talk about an unreal situation, you can use 'would + infinitive'.
  Example: My dream job would be to teach children to sail.
  Some useful words:
   maybe, perhaps
   It is fairly/quite/very/extremely likely/unlikely (that) ... It is fairly likely I would need more qualifications.
   I'd hazard a guess that ...: I'm not sure, but I'd hazard a guess that it's not as well paid as being an accountant.
   It is quite possible that ...
   I imagine/suspect that...: I suspect that I wouldn't find it very satisfying role.
   Mush + infinitive:
   can't + infinitive: It can't be very rewarding.

Practise skill:
  record your answer.
  listen your record, note down errors and the place needed improve.
    time tense, phrase, accent, pronuciation

Paragraph:
  The person I'm closest to in my family is definitely my mum. We've always got on and we hardly ever fall out. She's really outgoing and sociable - she's always going out with her friends. Everyone thinks she's good fun. I look up to her because she's so hard working - she never sits still and she works long hours. She can be a bit impatient, though - she gets annoyed when her colleagues aren't as efficient as her. I take after her in that, I'm impatient too. She's over-sensitive, often getting offended for seemingly no reason.
  My cousin Kieron and I grew up together. We were inseparable. He was so creative - he'd always think of new games we could play and make up these stories to make me laugh. I was constantly amazed by his open mindedness as well- he was never judgemental. I wish I could be like that. Unfortunately, we grew apart, slowly but surely, and by the time we went to uni we weren't in touch any more. I haven't see him for years. It's really sad. I would blame it partly on the fact that he's not very reliable, so for example, if I email him he won't respond. I'm not sure what he's up to these days.
  My family is everything to me. They are my best friends, they support me when things aren't going well and when things are going well. I know they'll always be there for me, no matter what.
  I'm self-employed. I give art classes , mainly to retired people. I many not earn a great deal but I get an immense amount of job satisfication, because I see people who have barely held a brush before gain in confidence and learn new skills. I don't think I could cope with having an office job - the monotony would drive me mad. People in offices seem to work long hours, and there's always the risk of being made redundant or getting sacked. Nobody can fire me because I'm my own boss.
  I'm a water engineer. In my current job, I'm responsible for designing flood defence systems and monitoring flood levels. I must admit that I'm a bit of a workaholic. I'm constantly doing overtime - unpaid, I should add - and so I generally get home late. I would definitely say I live to work, not work to live. Years ago, I did a lot of volunteer work, advising people in developing countries on installing  water supplies. However, since I 've now settle down and am the main breadwinner, I feel I have to earn a decent wage. My wife works part-time but she only went back to work last month. Before that, she was a stay-at-home mum. I think she enjoyed looking after the kids but she's always been quite career-minded so she didn't want to stay a housewife forever.
Sentence:
  I consider myself to be...
  I would say I was...
  I know this is a cliche, but...
  I don't get go on with ...
