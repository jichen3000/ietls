Paragraph:
  The person I'm closest to in my family is definitely my mum. We've always got on and we hardly ever fall out. She's really outgoing and sociable - she's always going out with her friends. Everyone thinks she's good fun. I look up to her because she's so hard working - she never sits still and she works long hours.
  She can be a bit impatient, though - she gets annoyed when her colleagues aren't as efficient as her. I take after her in that, I'm impatient too. She's over-sensitive, often getting offended for seemingly no reason.
