Paragraph:
  The person I'm closest to in my family is definitely my mum. We've always got on and we hardly ever fall out. She's really outgoing and sociable - she's always going out with her friends. Everyone thinks she's good fun. I look up to her because she's so hard working - she never sits still and she works long hours. She can be a bit impatient, though - she gets annoyed when her colleagues aren't as efficient as her. I take after her in that, I'm impatient too. She's over-sensitive, often getting offended for seemingly no reason.
  My cousin Kieron and I grew up together. We were inseparable. He was so creative - he'd always think of new games we could play and make up these stories to make me laugh. I was constantly amazed by his open mindedness as well- he was never judgemental. I wish I could be like that. Unfortunately, we grew apart, slowly but surely, and by the time we went to uni we weren't in touch any more. I haven't see him for years. It's really sad. I would blame it partly on the fact that he's not very reliable, so for example, if I email him he won't respond. I'm not sure what he's up to these days.
  My family is everything to me. They are my best friends, they support me when things aren't going well and when things are going well. I know they'll always be there for me, no matter what.
