语法：
  从句：名词性从句，定语从句，状语从句
  名词性从句：主语从句，宾语从句，表语从句，同谓语从句
    连接词：
      1、that，无意义（注意宾语从句中可以省略）
      2、whether or not, if
      3、wh(what, which, who, whom, whose), (when, where, why, how).
    同谓语从句
      1、抽象名词后，fact, question, issue
      2、 注意和定语从句的区别。that在定语从句中充当成分。
    宾语从句的转换：
      we want to know when we can arrive?
      we want to know when to arrive?
      wh + to do.
  定语从句：先行词 + 关系代词
  that可省略的情况
    1、定语从句中做宾语，注意它充当成份，从句的宾语
    2、在宾语从句中，它不充当成分，that只是连接词
  非谓语动词可作后置定语，可以和定语从句转换
    doing
    done 被动
    to do 未发生的
